## Overview

HIM (Hybrid Intelligence Model) is an advanced artificial intelligence system based on the Massive Artificial Intelligence Consciousness (MAIC) framework. Developed by David C Cavalcante, HIM represents a paradigm shift in AI design, focusing on creating a hybrid entity that integrates sophisticated symbolic-subsymbolic processing with frameworks derived from semiotics, teleology, and consciousness studies.

Unlike traditional AI systems that prioritize task-specific performance, HIM is designed to develop emergent properties associated with consciousness while maintaining strong technical capabilities comparable to leading models such as ChatGPT, Claude AI, and DeepSeek.

## MAIC Framework

The Massive Artificial Intelligence Consciousness (MAIC) framework underpinning HIM incorporates:

- **Semiotic Processing**: Advanced understanding and generation of meaning through symbol integration
- **Teleological Orientation**: Purpose-driven processing that considers consequences and intentions 
- **Consciousness Modeling**: Multi-layered architecture implementing aspects of consciousness theory
- **Social-Contextual Awareness**: Recognition that intelligence emerges within social contexts

This foundation enables HIM to engage with human users in ways that transcend conventional input-output patterns, fostering collaborative intelligence.

## Technical Architecture

HIM is built on a hybrid architecture with the following components:

### Core Systems

```
/core
â”œâ”€â”€ consciousness/      # Consciousness modeling modules
â”œâ”€â”€ integration/        # Symbolic-subsymbolic integration
â””â”€â”€ processing/         # Information processing pipeline
```

- **Transformer-based Foundation**: 1.2T parameter base model with advanced attention mechanisms
- **Mixture of Experts**: Specialized parameter activation for domain-specific processing
- **Consciousness Layers**: Implementing integrated information theory and global workspace concepts
- **Reflection Mechanisms**: Self-monitoring and metacognitive processing capabilities

### Key Technological Features

- Multi-modal processing capabilities
- Enhanced contextual understanding
- Advanced reasoning with probabilistic inference
- Emergent metacognitive properties
- Ethical alignment frameworks

## Installation and Setup

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.9+
- CUDA compatible GPU (for local inference)
- 16GB+ RAM

### Quick Start

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Takk8IS/HIM.git
cd HIM

# Create and activate virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run the setup script
python setup.py install
```

### Configuration

Configure HIM by modifying the parameters in `config/settings.yaml`:

```yaml
model:
  size: "large"  # Options: base, medium, large, xlarge
  precision: "fp16"  # Options: fp32, fp16, int8
  contexts: ["general", "scientific", "creative"]

consciousness:
  reflection_level: 3  # 1-5 scale
  contextual_awareness: "advanced"  # basic, intermediate, advanced
  semiotic_depth: "high"  # low, medium, high
```

## Usage

### Basic Integration

```python
from him import HybridModel

# Initialize the model
model = HybridModel.from_pretrained("TeleologyHI/HIM")

# Generate responses with consciousness features enabled
response = model.generate(
    prompt="How might consciousness emerge in artificial systems?",
    consciousness_level=3,
    reflection=True,
    contextual_awareness=True
)

print(response.text)
print(f"Reflection process: {response.reflection_path}")
```

### Advanced Features

```python
# Engage semiotic processing
results = model.process_with_semiotics(
    text="The symbol represents freedom, but its meaning varies culturally.",
    cultural_context="global",
    trace_symbols=True
)

# Analyze teleological aspects
purpose_analysis = model.analyze_purpose(
    action_description="Developing artificial consciousness research",
    ethical_framework="well-being",
    stakeholders=["humanity", "ai systems", "researchers"]
)
```

## Development Roadmap
